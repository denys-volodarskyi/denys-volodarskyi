## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about reverse engineering and creating my own RCE tools. Commercially and for fun. 

- x86, x64 and ARM. And some less popular.
- I prefer C# and C++.
- File formats, packers/unpackers, protectors... (disassembling everything)

Contact me if you're interested to collaborate on:

- C#: Parsing and extracting runtime type information for known compilers,
  including Delphi, Visual Basic, Fox Pro and other.
- C#: Graph visualization, layout and rendering.
- VMProtect unpacking and devirtualization.

Or if you have good paid contract :)
